# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation using unsupervised learning
Some quick and easy segmentation using K-means, DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering with 2 variables and an example of K-means with 3 variables, evaluation with elbow diagrams, silhouette score and some diagrams. I also do some summaries and supervised learning to predict clusters for new customers, but I focus on evaluating the cluster algorithms.
